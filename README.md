# Entropy-Propagation
[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)

## Requirements
- Python 3.8
- Poetry 1.1
- graphviz (optional)
- manim (optional)

## Setup (tested on MacOS and Windows)
1. Download & install the latest python 3.8 release from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/) 

2. Download and install poetry as explained [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)

3. Optional: Install graphviz
    ```
    Mac:
    brew install graphviz
   
    Windows:
    choco install graphviz
    ```
   
4.1. Optional: Install manim dependencies as described [here](https://docs.manim.community/en/v0.1.0/installation.html)

4.2. Optional: Run ``` poetry add manimce==0.1 ``` to add manim to poetry


5. Run ``` poetry install ``` in the root of the repository to create a virtual environment 
and install the required dependencies
   
6. Run one of the run scripts ...

    6.1. ... using the command line

    ```
    poetry shell
   
    poetry run python rl/main_dataset.py
    poetry run python rl/main.py
    poetry run python supervised/main.py
    ```

    6.2. ... through an IDE:
     - Select the poetry venv as interpreter & run one of the run scripts


## Graphviz
If Graphviz is installed, the architecture images can be generated by using 
the ```save_model_architecture_images()``` method that is implemented in *Network* and its inheriting classes 
(e.g. *NetworkRL* and *NetworkSupervised*)

## Manim
Manim is required to use the *RLScene* class script in ```animation/network_scene```.
If it is set up, a video file can be generated by running 
```
manim animation/network_scene.py RLScene -p -qp
```
More information about manim can be found [here](https://docs.manim.community/en/v0.1.0/index.html)

### RLScene
- animates the training process of the Reinforcement Learner
- not designed to be too generic
   - might need adjustments when changing parameters
    

## Black
Black is used to ensure a consistent code style. Additionally, a
pre-commit hook is configured and can be activated by running ```pre-commit install```

If it is activated, the code is analyzed during a commit.
If adjustments are necessary, the following happens:
- the commit fails
- the code gets automatically adjusted according to the Black style guide

The changes then need to be re-added and committed again.


## Troubleshooting
This section lists problems encountered during the work and the required steps to resolve them
### SSL Certificate issue
Occurred on macOS. Can be fixed when running the following command to install 
necessary certificates:
```bash
/Applications/Python 3.8/Install Certificates.command
```

## Good to know
1. All run scripts are designed to be invoked from the root directory! 
   (e.g. running ```main_dataset.py``` from within the *rl* folder does not work)
